# PING

A PONG game clone I made using Python with the PyGame module

You can find the game on https://ItsAiZEN.itch.io/Ping as an executable (no need for python or pygame)

#### Important note

Make sure you install the PyGame module, use package manager to install, such as:

```
pip install pygame
```
